Having a thoughtful, meaningful git commit log is important in order to maintain a project long term

Keep it as simple as possible

spell check everything, keep it readable

From [source](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/):

  ## The seven rules of a great Git commit message
 
 
    * Separate subject from body with a blank line
    
    * Limit the subject line to 50 characters
   
    * Capitalize the subject line
   
    * Do not end the subject line with a period
   
    * Use the imperative mood in the subject line
   
    * Wrap the body at 72 characters
   
    * Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
