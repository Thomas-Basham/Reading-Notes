Each step of a script is a statement. all statements end with a ;

each statement is an instruction

Scripts store data in variables

strings can be stored in variables

booleans can be stored in variables

From Book:

Here are six rules you must always follow when giving a variable a name:
1. The name must begin with
a letter, dollar sign ($), or an
underscore (_). It must not start
with a number.
2. The name can contain letters,
numbers, dollar sign ($), or an
underscore (_). Note that you
must not use a dash (-) or a
period (.) in a variable name.
3. You cannot use keywords or
reserved words. Keywords
are special words that tell the
interpreter to do something. For
example, var is a keyword used
to declare a variable. Reserved
words are ones that may be used
in a future version of JavaScript.

reserved words in JavaScript.
4. All variables are case sensitive,
so score and Score would be
different variable names, but
it is bad practice to create two
variables that have the same
name using different cases.
5. Use a name that describes the
kind of information that the
variable stores. For example,
firstName might be used to
store a person's first name,
lastName for their last name,
and age for their age.
6. If your variable name is made
up of more than one word, use a
capital letter for the first letter of
every word after the first word.
For example, firstName rather
than firstname (this is referred
to as camel case). You can also
use an underscore between each
word (you cannot use a dash).
