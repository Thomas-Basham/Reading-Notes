## From the Duckett JS book':'

    Review from Reading 02 - Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions” (pp.70-73)
          Array's store a list of values in javascript

          the first index will always be 0 for the first value

          flexible

    Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” from switch statements on (pp.162-182)
          If...else statement's use a conditional statement (if/else), a variable condition, if code block, and else code block.  

          if else statements give you two sets of code: One set if condition is evaluates to true, the other if false. 

          switch statements give the user a different message depending which level they're at

          use strict equals operators === and !==

          there are falsy and truthy value
