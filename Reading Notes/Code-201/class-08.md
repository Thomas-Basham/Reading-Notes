## Learn CSS - Layout
[Learn CSS - Layout](https://web.dev/learn/css/layout/)

  pages used to be styled using table elements

  block elements form a new line

  flexbox and grid are the two layout systems

  flexbox is for one dimensional layouts

  grid controls multi axis layouts

  "Using inline-block gives you a box that has some of the characteristics of a block-level element, but still flows inline with the text."

  stylize lists with column-count and column-gap

## Duckett HTML/CSS book: Ch. 15, “Layout” (again; repeat of Class 4 reading)

  CSS treats each element as if its in its own box

  boxes can either be block-level box or inline box

  positioning schemes let you control the layout of the page

  float propoerty allows you to take an element such as a quote and move it to right or left of flow 

  if a containing element only contains floated elelmments, it may not appear on browser and you need another css rule applied to the element. in the book the example rules were overflow: auto; and width: 100%;

  most web pages are 960*1000 px wide 

  fixed width layouts stay the same size when ethe window changes

  liquid layouts change with the window size
  
  css frameworks save time and give you css code for a specicic style
