## [How I explained REST to my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

### Who is Roy Fielding?

    He is a computer scientist who helped write the HTTP protocol and came up with the state transfer architectural style

### Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

    Because the web wasn't initially set up for all of the api transfers that there are now

### What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

    when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

    HTTP is a general purpose protocol for applying verbs to nouns

### What does a GET do?

    It get's the http protocol resources to display

### What does a POST do?

    If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST.

### What does PUT do?

    If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT

### What does PATCH do?

    A partial update
