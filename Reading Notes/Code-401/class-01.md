    This is a good reminder to remember my "why" for those moments when I'm feeling exhausted and thinking about quitting. I know this will be a rewarding experience if instead of giving up, just take a break and continue on. 

### [Beginners Guide to Big O](https://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation/)

    This was hard to wrap my head around at first but after researching the topic more it's clear that Big O notation is used to evaluate the code written to determine its overall efficiency. More inefficient code won't work as great when scaled so it's important to write efficient, low memory using code. I linked the article I found below.

### [Names and Values in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AEJHKGk9ns)

- Python works like other languages until it doesn't

- In python memory is managed dynamically which means that values exist until there are no more references to them

- If you keep track of where you have immutable values and where you do not, you have an opportunity to write good, scalable code.
