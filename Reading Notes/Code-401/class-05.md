Think of a linked list like kids on a school bus. There are Singly linked lists and there are Doubly linked lists.  On a singly schoolbus the kids are only allowed to look forward and can't talk to the students behind them. On a doubly linked bus the bus driver is super chill and the students are allowed to talk to their classmates behind them and in front. Think of the children as nodes. The Head would be the busdriver, if they were driving from the back seat of the bus.
