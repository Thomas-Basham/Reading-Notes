### [Python Scope](https://realpython.com/python-scope-legb-rule/)
- The Python scope concept is generally presented using a rule known as the LEGB rule
- The letters in the acronym LEGB stand for:
  - Local scopes: The names that you define in this scope are only available or visible to the code within the scope
  - Enclosing scopes
  - Global scopes: The names that you define in this scope are available to all your code
  - Built-in scopes
- the scope of a name defines the area of a program in which you can unambiguously access that name
- Global and Local are the most common 
- If you can access a name, then it's within scope

### [Don’t be CONFUSED by BIG O notation anymore!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Uqawfl0VHQ)
- Big O time: A measure of how long an algorithm takes to do something
- Big O Space: A measure of how much memory it uses while performing algorithm
- Big O notation is a way of measuring how an algorithm will respond to an increasing amount of data that it needs to process
- The measurement is the worst case scenario of the algorithm
- Types of Big O computational complexities/running times:
  - O(n) linear running time
  - O(nᴷ) Quadratic Complexity
  - Recursive Complexity
  - O(1) Constant complexity
  - O(log n) logarithmic complexity
  - O(n logn) Log linear complexity
- Logarithmic running times scale well because they return a lot of data in a small amount of time
- Summing items is a linear Complexity
- Comparing one item with other is a quadratic complexity 
- Comparing every item is an exponential complexity
- Constant time complexity returning booleans
