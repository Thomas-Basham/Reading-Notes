### [Stacks and Queues](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-10/resources/stacks_and_queues.html)
- A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. 
- Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.
- Stacks follow the First In Last Out concept which means the first item in will be the last removed and vise versa
- Queues follow the first in first out concept

Stacks can be viewed physically as a literal stack of items. You can only remove the top item, and you can only add a new item on top

Queues can be seen as a literal queue or line to get into or out of a building and everyone must stay in line to get in or out.
