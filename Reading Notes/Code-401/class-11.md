### [What is Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html)

- JupyterLab is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data.
- Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning.
- Notebook documents are documents produced by the Jupyter Notebook App, which contain both computer code and rich text elements.

[Numpy Tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/numpy-tutorial-python/)

- NumPy is a commonly used Python data analysis package
- Numpy works with arrays
- In a NumPy array, the number of dimensions is called the rank, and each dimension is called an axis.
- NumPy stores values using its own data types, which are distinct from Python types like float and str
- You can find the data type of a NumPy array by accessing the .dtype property
- NumPy Array Methods:

      numpy.ndarray.mean — finds the mean of an array.

      numpy.ndarray.std — finds the standard deviation of an array.

      numpy.ndarray.min — finds the minimum value in an array.

      numpy.ndarray.max — finds the maximum value in an array.

- semicolon separated values or SSV is the format for organizing data
- The CSV package and the csv.reader object allows us to read in and split up all the content from the SSV file
