### [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app)

- To build a complete web application with React from scratch, there are many important details you need to consider:
 
        Code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack and transformed using a compiler like Babel.
        You need to do production optimizations such as code splitting.
        You might want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO. You might also want to use server-side rendering or client-side rendering.
        You might have to write some server-side code to connect your React app to your data store.

### [Why to use Next.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtgbaKBhdkk)
