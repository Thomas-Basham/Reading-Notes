### [React - Conditional Rendering](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html)
- In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need
- Then, you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your application.
- 
### [React - Lists & Keys](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)
- Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed
- Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity
- Add a key to .map elements 
### [React - Forms](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)
- HTML form elements work a bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state
### [React - Lifting State](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html)
- Often, several components need to reflect the same changing data
- We recommend lifting the shared state up to their closest common ancestor. Let’s see how this works in action.
### [React - Composition vs Inheritance](https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html)
- Some components don’t know their children ahead of time
- This is especially common for components like Sidebar or Dialog that represent generic “boxes”.
- We recommend that such components use the special children prop to pass children elements directly into their output
