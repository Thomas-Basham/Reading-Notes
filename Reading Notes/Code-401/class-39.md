##3 [React Context for Beginners](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/react-context-for-beginners/)
- React context allows us to pass down and use (consume) data in whatever component we need in our React app without using props
- React context is great when you are passing data that can be used in any component in your application.
- These types of data include:
    
        Theme data (like dark or light mode)
        User data (the currently authenticated user)
        Location-specific data (like user language or locale)
- React context helps us avoid the problem of props drilling
- Props drilling is a term to describe when you pass props down multiple levels to a nested component, through components that don't need it
- Example:

        import React from 'react';
        
        export const UserContext = React.createContext();
        
        export default function App() {
          return (
            <UserContext.Provider value="Reed">
              <User />
            </UserContext.Provider>
          )
        }
        
        function User() {
          return (
            <UserContext.Consumer>
              {value => <h1>{value}</h1>} 
              {/* prints: Reed */}
            </UserContext.Consumer>
          )
        }
